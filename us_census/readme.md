## US Places
This data is derived from the 2023 Gazetteer Files available at [US Census Website](https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html).
I've attempted to fix data anomolies caused by metro and city-county consolidated areas.

## Census Designated Places
This data is aggregated and converted from data available via the [US Census Website](https://tigerweb.geo.census.gov/tigerwebmain/TIGERweb2020_cdp_census2020.html).

**NOTE:**

If you use this data, please star the project and attribute the aggregation work done to create the datafiles.
