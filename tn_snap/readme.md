# Tennessee SNAP Program Participation Data by County Since 2011.

This data is aggregated and converted from the pdfs and excel files located on the [State of TN Website](https://www.tn.gov/humanservices/for-families/supplemental-nutrition-assistance-program-snap/snap-statistical-information.html).  

If you use this data, please star the project and attribute the aggregation work done to create the datafiles.
